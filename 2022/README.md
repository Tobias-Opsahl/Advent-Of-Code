# Advent of Code 2022

This repo contains my solutions to [advent of code](https://adventofcode.com/) 2022. I completed 35/50 stars in December 2022, and have not yet done the rest. All of the solutions are coded in Python. This was my first year of solving Advent of Code, so I mainly focused on just completing some tasks, using a programming language I was already very familiar with.

I have focused on good codestyle and comments, so the code should be pretty understandable and well documented. However, the actual task should obviously be read first. Most solutions are pretty generic and have good complexibility, but there are lots of room to optimize further. Possible improvements are often marked in the codes comments.
