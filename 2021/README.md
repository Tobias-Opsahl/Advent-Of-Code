# Advent of Code 2021

This repo contains my solutions to [advent of code](https://adventofcode.com/2021) 2021. These tasks are solved long after 2021. The aim was to get a bit more familiar with C++, a language I had used just barely, but wanted to get more familiar with.

The inputs are stored in the ```input``` folder, the executables (compiled code) are stored in ```executables```, and the c++ files are stored in the base folder ```2021```. I use ```g++ (MinGW.org GCC-6.3.0-1) 6.3.0```. Code can be compiled and ran by running ```g++ -o executables\01_hard 01_hard.cpp && executables\01_hard.exe``` in the terminal.
