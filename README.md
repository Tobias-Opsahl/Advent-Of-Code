# Advent of Code

This repo contains my solutions to [advent of code](https://adventofcode.com/). They are not done rapidly or optimally, but generally have good codestyle and comments. Please read the README in the other folders and the files for more information.

Overview:

**2023:** Javascript. 6/50 stars.

**2022:** Python, 35/50 stars.

**2021:** C++, 4/50 stars.

Each of the days from 1st of December to 25th of December have two programming tasks, which i mark by ```n_easy``` and ```n_hard```, for day number ```n```. Each day have its own input-file. The input text is saved in a folder ```inputs```, added in its respective year-folder, called ```n_input.txt```. Most tasks have a small example input file from the task-description, which I call ```n_input_small.txt```. The programs for solving are solved are saved directly in the folder, with a relative path to the inputs. If there are unfinished tasks, they are added to the folder ```unfinished```, but keep in mind that they have to be saved in the base folder for the path to work.
