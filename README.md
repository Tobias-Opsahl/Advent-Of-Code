# Advent of Code

This repository contains my solutions to [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/). They are not done rapidly or optimally, but in the style I feel like doing at the time. I usually prioritize good codestyle, learning a new language, and sometimes try to get an elegant solution and good complexity. I never try to solve the tasks as fast as possible.

Overview:

**2025:** GoLang. 10 starts.

**2024:** Javascript. 50/50 stars.

**2022:** Python, 35/50 stars.

**2021:** C++, 4/50 stars.

Each of the days from 1st of December to 25th of December have two programming tasks, which i mark by ```n_easy``` and ```n_hard```, for day number ```n```. Each day have its own input-file. The input text is saved in a folder ```inputs```, added in its respective year-folder, called ```n_input.txt```. Most tasks have a small example input file from the task-description, which I call ```n_input_small.txt```. The main input is not shared, but the smaller inputs are. The programs for solving are solved are saved directly in the folder, with a relative path to the inputs. If there are unfinished tasks, they are added to the folder ```unfinished```, but keep in mind that they have to be saved in the base folder for the path to work.
