# Advent of Code 2022

This repo contains my solutions to [advent of code](https://adventofcode.com/) 2022. They are not done rapidly, but when I have time. They are all coded in python. Hopefully I will be able to also do the earlier years some time.

I have focused on good codestyle and comments, so the code should be pretty understandable and well documented. However, the actual task should obviously be read first. Most solutions are pretty generic and have good complexibility, but there are lost of room to optimize further. Possible improvements are often marked in the codes comments.
